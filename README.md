# Stock-analysis using VBA
## Our client had asked to anylize a set of tickers to see how they did in the stock market in the past of couple of years.I created "for" loops and "if then" statement to analyze all the rows with the ticker index to ouput the return for that specific index. I then applied conditional formatting so the  return could stand out wether ticker was in the green that year or in the red.
### Based on our analysis it appears that 2017 was better year for the stock market, thus 2018 being a bad year if you had prior stock ownership of those tickers listed in our analysis. Although 2018 was a bad year for the previous stock owners it provides and opportunity to buy new stocks at a lower price and hope for the stock market to rebound in the near future to provide stock gains. See analysis below:

# Summary
## Advantages of refactoring a code it should be easier to understands and easier to maintain. A disadvantage of refactoring is time consuming.
## Advantages of the original code it was broken up into sub routines to make it easier undstand the steps, a disadvantage was when doing the all stock analysis on the original code, the codes worked but not unified which caused a break in my output. I had to combined some of the sub routines in the to the main to make it all one.
